# Basic Keylogger Program

## Overview

This script is a simple keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes to a file. It uses the `pynput` library to monitor keyboard inputs and save the keystrokes to a log file named `keylog.txt`. This tool is useful for understanding how keylogging works and for educational purposes.

## Features

- Logs all keystrokes (including special keys) to `keylog.txt`.
- Provides real-time feedback on the console for both key presses and releases.
- Stops logging when the ESC key is pressed.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you need to have Python and the `pynput` library installed. You can install `pynput` using pip:

```bash
pip install pynput
